"""Round-3 synth: target the ~230k records whose `thought:` line is one of
the 9 trivial placeholders. These pass shallow non-empty checks but provide
zero supervised reasoning signal — replace each with a Groq-synthesized
first-person inner thought.

Reads:
  data/synthesized/review/trivial_by_source/*.jsonl
  data/synthesized/manual_reasoning/thoughts.jsonl   (rounds 1+2, append-only)

Writes:
  appends to data/synthesized/manual_reasoning/thoughts.jsonl with `"round": 3`

Resume semantics: a key is "done" only if its existing thought passes
is_clean AND is NOT one of the trivial placeholders. Trivial-thought keys
are always re-synthesized (a previous round may have written the trivial
value back). still_dirty entries always re-queue.
