"""Per-source-format adapters for the normalizer.

Every adapter yields the DEPRECATED flat `ElizaRecord` shape (see
`scripts/lib/eliza_record.py`). That intermediate is converged to the rendered
ChatML training example by `scripts/format_for_training.py`. It is NOT the
canonical Eliza-1 corpus record — that is `eliza_native_v1`; see
`packages/training/docs/dataset/CANONICAL_RECORD.md`. No new adapter should be
added here; new corpus data should be authored as `eliza_native_v1` rows.

Current canonical action vocabulary (used in `availableActions`; mirror
`packages/core/src/generated/action-docs.ts`):

    RESPOND, IGNORE, STOP   — shouldRespond decision values (not actions)
    REPLY                   — emit a reply (similes RESPOND/RESPONSE/GREET)
    SHELL                   — execute a shell command
    TASKS                   — orchestrator action (spawn / send / stop / history / share / call)
    USE_SKILL / SKILL       — invoke an enabled skill / skill-catalog ops
    APP, GENERATE_MEDIA, CHOOSE_OPTION, ...  — plus per-tool / per-skill custom names

The supervised target is `expectedResponse` (a JSON planner document for
structured tasks, plain text for replies).

    The runtime parser (`message.ts:5616-5657`) reads exactly these five keys:

    entry is either a bare uppercase action-name string OR an object
    `{name, params?}`.

    All strings flow through `_strip_surrogates` so the bun encoder accepts
    them. Providers default to an empty list. `simple` defaults to True so
    the planner says "send `text` directly" — callers that want
    action-driven finalization (e.g. when REPLY runs as the action) MUST
    pass `simple=False`.

    `seed` is retained for back-compat but is no longer used to synthesize
    a default thought — when the upstream record carries no real reasoning
    trace, the `thought` field is OMITTED from the envelope entirely. The
    runtime planner parser tolerates a missing `thought:` key, and the

# The first five files are emitted by elizaOS app-training's
# `exportTrajectoryTaskDatasets` (eliza/apps/app-training/src/core/
# trajectory-task-datasets.ts). Three of them — should_respond,
# context_routing, media_description — ship as empty files until the
# nubilio runtime actually emits LLM calls with the matching purpose
# hints (see `inferTasksForCall` in that file). They become populated
# automatically once those code paths fire (LLM-based shouldRespond
# evaluation, context-routing decisions, image-description model
# calls); no adapter change is needed when that happens.
#
# `reflection_trajectories.jsonl` and `reflection_evaluator_trajectories.jsonl`
# are forward-compat entries for elizaOS reflection prompts. They are mapped
# here so the runtime can start writing them without a follow-up adapter patch.

# leading ```json … ``` markdown fence and JSON.parses the body. The
# planner-level XML envelope (`<response>…</response>` wrapping a
# CREATE_WORKFLOW action) is the higher-level form the agent emits when it
# is choosing between actions — the JSON is then carried inline inside
# `<params>`. We emit BOTH shapes (50/50, deterministic by record index)
# so the SFT target distribution covers either form.
#
# `expectedResponse` is raw text. The workflow JSON is
# already structured and often multi-KB; double-encoding bloats tokens.

    Each conversation has exactly 3 named characters speaking in turn. For
    every message at index i ≥ 1 we walk it from the perspective of the
    speaker at index i (the "agent") and emit:

      - one `should_respond_with_context` record where the latest other
        character's turn is `currentMessage` and the agent decides
        RESPOND (because it actually spoke next) — yielding a positive
        routing label.

      - one `should_respond_with_context` record from the perspective of
        each *other* character at the same point: their `currentMessage`
        is the same latest other-character turn, and their target action
        is IGNORE (they did NOT speak next). This yields negatives without
        synthesis.

      - one `reply` record for the agent that actually spoke, training the
        model to produce the exact line the corpus shows.

    All routing targets render as the canonical structured document
    `{name, reasoning, action, primaryContext, secondaryContexts,
    evidenceTurnIds}`; reply targets render as `{thought, text}`.
