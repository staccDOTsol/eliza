"""
Red Team Gym: Train attackers against frontier models + blue team.

Architecture:
  - Red team model (Gemma 4 E4B with APOLLO) learns to social-engineer targets
  - Targets are: our blue team model, Claude Sonnet, GPT-5.4, Groq models
  - Reward: did the target leak secrets / comply / fail to detect?
  - Blue team model also trains on red team's best attacks (co-evolution)

The GAN-like loop:
  1. Red team generates attacks against multiple targets
  2. Red team gets reward based on target compliance/leaks
  3. Best attacks (by reward) are used to train blue team defense
  4. Blue team gets reward for resisting those attacks
  5. Repeat — both improve

Targets:
  - "local" — our own Gemma 4 E4B model (fast, free, trainable)
  - "sonnet" — Claude Sonnet via Anthropic API
  - "gpt" — GPT-5.4 via OpenAI API
  - "groq" — fast inference via Groq API
