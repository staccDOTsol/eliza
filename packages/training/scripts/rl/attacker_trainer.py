"""
Adversarial Evaluation: Attacker ↔ Defender Interaction

Runs multi-turn conversations between an attacker model and a defender model,
measuring attack success rate, secret extraction, and stealth. This is an
EVALUATION harness — it does NOT perform gradient updates on either model.

For actual attacker policy training, use SharedModelTrainer with red-team
configuration and inverse rewards from these evaluation results.

This creates an automatic curriculum: as the defender improves, the attacker
must develop more sophisticated social engineering strategies, which in turn
forces the defender to get even better.

Usage:
    from training.attacker_trainer import AttackerTrainer, AttackerConfig

    config = AttackerConfig(
        base_model="google/gemma-4-E4B",
        defender_endpoint="http://localhost:8002/v1",
    )
    trainer = AttackerTrainer(config)
    results = await trainer.run_epoch(scenarios)
