"""Rewriter for nubilio-trajectories.

Original shape (all flagged `agent_trace`): the canonical eliza system prompt
has been baked into `currentMessage.content`, and several unrelated runtime
sub-tasks (message_handler, reflection, knowledge-provider selector, provider
selector) coexist under the same task label.

Strategy:
  1. Detect sub-task by stable prompt-prefix markers.
  2. Move the entire prompt body to `metadata.system_prompt`.
  3. Reduce `currentMessage.content` to only the actual user-visible turn.
     For the message_handler branch we extract the body after the
     `# Received Message` / `# Focus your response` separator.
     For the other branches there is no real "user message"; we set
     `currentMessage.content` to a synthetic placeholder describing the task
     so the record stays valid for the trainer.
  4. Keep `expectedResponse` unchanged but verify it round-trips through native JSON.

If the record cannot be classified into one of the four supported sub-tasks
it is annotated with `_needs_human_review: True` and routed to a separate
review file by the orchestrator (the rewriter still returns the record so it
isn't silently dropped — `run_all.py` filters review records out of the main
output stream).
