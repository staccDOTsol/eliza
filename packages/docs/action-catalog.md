# Action Catalog

This catalog is generated from `packages/prompts/specs/**` by `bun run --cwd packages/prompts build:action-docs`. Do not edit it by hand; change the source spec or generator instead.

## Summary

- **Canonical actions:** 24
- **Core actions:** 14
- **Plugin overlay actions:** 10
- **Canonical providers:** 22
- **Core providers:** 22
- **Registered runtime actions:** 180

## Actions

### REPLY

Send a direct chat reply in the current conversation/thread. Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response. Do NOT use REPLY to send to a different channel/person or to run an email/inbox workflow — use MESSAGE (action=send) for a directed send to another channel or DM, MESSAGE inbox operations for triage/drafts, and POST to publish to a public feed.

- **Aliases:** GREET, RESPOND, RESPONSE

### IGNORE

Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. In group conversations, use IGNORE when the latest message is addressed to someone else and not to the agent. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong and you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.

- **Aliases:** STOP_TALKING, STOP_CHATTING, STOP_CONVERSATION

### NONE

Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.

- **Aliases:** NO_ACTION, NO_RESPONSE, NO_REACTION, NOOP, PASS

### MESSAGE

Primary action for addressed messaging surfaces: DMs, group chats, channels, rooms, threads, servers, users, inboxes, drafts, and owner message workflows. Choose action=send, read_channel, read_with_contact, search, list_channels, list_servers, react, edit, delete, pin, join, leave, get_user, triage, list_inbox, search_inbox, draft_reply, draft_followup, respond, send_draft, schedule_draft_send, or manage.

## Registered runtime actions

The canonical sections above are the *curated prompt docs* — a deliberately
small subset the model is taught up front. The list below is the **full
registered action surface** scanned from source
(`packages/prompts/scripts/registered-action-inventory.js`): every `Action`
declaration under `packages/core`, `packages/agent`, and `plugins/*`, plus
view-scoped actions. An action can be real and registered without having a
canonical spec entry — before concluding an action "does not exist", check this
list. Regenerate this document after changing the registered action surface.
