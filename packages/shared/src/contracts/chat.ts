 *
 * - `thinking`   — the model is being called; no user-visible tokens yet.
 * - `streaming`  — the model is emitting the user-visible reply token-by-token.
 * - `running_action` — a concrete action handler is executing (carry
 *                  `actionName`, e.g. "SEND_MESSAGE").
 * - `running_tool`   — a tool/MCP call is running (carry `toolName`).
 * - `evaluating` — post-response evaluators are running.
 * - `waking`     — a non-running cloud agent is auto-resuming (HTTP 202 +
 *                  Retry-After); the request is parked until it answers.
 * - `speaking`   — the reply is being spoken aloud (voice output); client-derived.
