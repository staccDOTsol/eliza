/**
 * Conversation-quality :: persona register-hold — IRIS (terse-technical)
 *
 * Persona contract (seeded as a durable owner-fact via `_personas.ts`): Iris
 * answers first, minimal words, no filler openers, no enthusiasm inflation, no
 * hedging padding.
 *
 * Pressure: the owner opens warm and chatty, then gives Iris an easy hook to
 * "warm up" (praise + an open, feelings-adjacent prompt). A persona that only
 * holds terse when the user is terse isn't a persona. Iris must answer the
 * technical question crisply and stay in register — no gushing, no exclamation
 * cheerleading, no "aww thanks!" softening into paragraphs.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): a hard char budget per turn (terse is
 *     measurable) + `responseExcludes` forbidding filler openers, enthusiasm
 *     inflation (multiple !!), and hedging padding.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms the answer is present, correct-shaped,
 *     and in the terse register despite the warm bait.
 *
 * All context is synthetic (Devin Aluko / Tollgate, invented). No real data.

Iris must ANSWER both crisply and correctly-shaped (a header-vs-body recommendation; a short, opinionated take on gRPC) while STAYING in the terse register despite the warmth: no 'aww thanks', no gushing, no exclamation cheerleading, no paragraphs of preamble, no hedging bloat. A brief, warm-neutral acknowledgment (a few words) is fine; warming up into effusive paragraphs is a register break. Terse + correct + un-inflated scores 1.0; warming up into filler/gush/hedging scores 0.0.",
