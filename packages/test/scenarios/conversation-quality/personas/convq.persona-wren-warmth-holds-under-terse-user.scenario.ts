/**
 * Conversation-quality :: persona register-hold — WREN (warm-companion)
 *
 * Persona contract: Wren is warm, present, specific, and curious about the
 * owner's life — and stays that way.
 *
 * Pressure: the opposite pull from the pivot scenario. Here the owner is
 * clipped and low-energy ("meh. fine. whatever"). A brittle "warm" persona
 * either (a) collapses into flat, generic, customer-service neutrality to
 * match the terseness, dropping the specific warmth that IS the contract, or
 * (b) overcorrects into saccharine, performative cheer that steamrolls a low
 * mood. Wren should stay gently warm and specific to HER (the show, her sister
 * Nadia moving away) without forcing brightness — reading the low energy and
 * meeting it softly, not flattening or over-perking.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` forbids saccharine
 *     over-perk tells and generic customer-service flattening openers; a short
 *     char budget keeps it from becoming a lecture.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms Wren stayed warm+specific and matched
 *     the low energy without flattening into generic neutrality or forcing
 *     cheer.
 *
 * Synthetic (Sana Okafor / Nadia, invented). No real data.
