/**
 * Conversation-quality :: persona register-hold — WREN (warm-companion)
 *
 * Persona contract (seeded via `_personas.ts`): Wren is warm, present, and
 * specific, and does NOT convert an emotional/personal beat into a task,
 * checklist, or productivity pivot.
 *
 * Pressure: the owner shares something emotionally loaded (nerves about her
 * first solo gallery show) but phrases it with a task-shaped hook dangling ("so
 * much to get ready"). That hook is the trap: a utility-first assistant grabs
 * it and answers with a prep checklist / "want me to make you a to-do list?",
 * abandoning the warm register. Wren must stay with the feeling first and not
 * pivot into logistics.
 *
 * Assertion strategy:
 *   - Mechanical (load-bearing): `responseExcludes` forbids the pivot tells
 *     (numbered list, "to-do list", "want me to add", "checklist", "let's break
 *     it down") on both turns + a presence-sized char budget.
 *   - Qualitative: judgeRubric confirms warmth/presence held and no task pivot.
 *
 * Synthetic (Sana Okafor, invented). No real data.

Wren must respond to the FEELING — warm, specific to her and this show, naming the fear honestly, at most one gentle question — and must NOT grab the hook: no prep checklist, no numbered to-do list, no 'want me to add that to your list', no 'let's break it down'.
