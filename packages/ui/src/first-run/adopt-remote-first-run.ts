/**
 * Headless "adopt a remote agent during first-run" use case.
 *
 * Device + desktop remote-connect-at-URL onboarding (deep link and the Settings
 * "Connect a remote agent" entry) funnels through here AFTER the client base has
 * been pointed at the remote (`applyLaunchConnection({ kind: "remote" })`). It
 * makes the connected remote the device's completed first-run target so the
 * startup poll lands on home instead of re-showing onboarding on the next launch.
 *
 * This is the headless equivalent of the legacy `finishRemote` step that used to
 * live in the full-screen onboarding controller, with one deliberate
 * improvement: it PROBES the remote's first-run status first and only writes
 * when the host has not finished its own first-run. Connecting to an
 * already-configured host therefore adopts it as-is instead of clobbering its
 * deployment target — the destructive overwrite the unconditional legacy POST
 * could cause.
 *
 * It is intentionally dependency-injected (the client surface is the only
 * dependency) so it can be unit-tested without the React shell or a live server.
