# First-Run Setup

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `use-first-run-conductor.ts` | Headless in-chat conductor that seeds first-run chat turns, routes `__first_run__:` choices, and answers typed free text with a local echo persona. |
| `first-run-action-channel.ts` | The seam the chat send funnel consults: `__first_run__:` picks and (during onboarding) free text route to the conductor, never the server. |
| `first-run-finish.ts` | Single headless finish use case: runtime startup, cloud/remote binding, and exactly-once `/api/first-run` persistence. |
| `first-run.ts` | Deterministic first-run state helpers and submit payload builder. |
| `reload-into-first-run-runtime.ts` | Runtime-switch URL and storage reset helper used by Settings. |
| `deep-link-handler.ts` | Mobile deep-link adapter for selecting first-run runtime targets. |
| `runtime-target.ts` | Persisted runtime identity (local / remote / elizacloud / elizacloud-hybrid) used across the shell and mobile runtime. |
| `mobile-runtime-mode.ts` | Mobile-specific runtime mode persistence tied to the server target. |

## The onboarding surface (#12178)

While first-run is pending the floating chat is the shared half-height
conversation surface: pinned HALF with no opaque app backdrop, every collapse
path a no-op, and the same sheet remains open when setup completes until the
user intentionally folds it to the pill. A completed relaunch begins at that
pill; opening it restores the shared half-height composer.

Before setup completes, typed text routes to the local first-run conductor and
never the agent; seeded CHOICE/OAuth widgets remain the shortest path. Attach
and mic stay disabled because no agent is available yet, and the composer is
read-only only while an external sign-in attempt is active. The full contract (and
which seam enforces each guarantee) is documented in
[`IN_CHAT_ONBOARDING_DESIGN.md`](./IN_CHAT_ONBOARDING_DESIGN.md) and covered by
`../components/shell/ChatOverlay.firstrun.test.tsx`.
