# In-chat onboarding status

First-run onboarding now renders in the real `ChatOverlay` over the
normal app shell. The old full-screen first-run gate, `FirstRunChat` surface,
and standalone runtime chooser are no longer part of the shipped UI.

The current first-run flow is seeded by `use-first-run-conductor.ts` as inline
chat choices:

- `choice-__first_run__:runtime:{cloud|local}` (the runtime location is a clean
  two-option chooser as of #11509; "Bring your own keys" is not a location — it
  lives on the provider axis below. Remote lives in Settings → Runtime post-#9952.)
- `choice-__first_run__:provider:{on-device|elizacloud|other}`
- `choice-__first_run__:tutorial:{start|skip}`

Those choices route into the headless first-run finish path and produce a single
`POST /api/first-run`. Tests should assert the real chat overlay plus transcript
choices and should keep negative assertions for deleted surfaces such as
`first-run-runtime-chooser`, `first-run-chat`, and
`startup-first-run-background`.

Current end-to-end evidence is attached inline to the issue/PR from the
Playwright artifact tree (`test-results` / per-test output): JPG screenshots,
recordings when enabled, and the relevant console/network excerpts. Specs should
not write repo-local evidence folders.

## The onboarding surface (#9952 → relaxed by #12178)

While first-run is pending, the shell passes `firstRunOpen={firstRunComplete
=== false}` to `ChatOverlay` (`App.tsx`). `firstRunOpen` turns the
overlay into a **full-screen onboarding surface** — the chat is the first
painted surface over the shared wallpaper, and it cannot be dismissed until
onboarding completes. Typed text routes to the local conductor before cloud
sign-in, while the choice turn remains the fastest pre-auth input. The contract, enforced in
`ChatOverlay.tsx` and covered by `ChatOverlay.firstrun.test.tsx`:

- **Opens pinned at FULL.** Initial detent is `full` when `firstRunOpen`; a
  falling-edge-guarded effect re-pins to FULL on every change while
  `firstRunOpen` is true, so nothing can step it down.
- **Wallpaper-only backdrop.** While `firstRunOpen`, a neutral scrim
  (`data-testid="chat-first-run-backdrop"`) sits above the shared wallpaper and
  below the transparent full-screen chat surface. The retained home/launcher
  surface is `visibility:hidden`, so no clock, widget, notification, or app tile
  leaks through while the wallpaper remains visible.
- **Composer is conductor-only.** Typed text is consumed locally by the
  first-run conductor and never reaches `/api/chat`. Attach, mic, push-to-talk,
  and slash commands remain unavailable; while external sign-in is active the
  textarea becomes read-only so the recovery turn stays authoritative.
- **Undismissable.** Every collapse path is a no-op while `firstRunOpen`:
  `collapse()` (the single funnel for Escape on document/thread/composer,
  outside-tap, and the grabber close/tap), the live drag (`onDragOffset`),
  pull-down and settle-free drag gestures, the header **clear** and **launcher**
  buttons, the conversation swipe, and — defense-in-depth — the
  `TUTORIAL_CHAT_CONTROL_EVENT` rest/reset/prefill handlers (unreachable in the
  real flow because the tour starts only after `completeFirstRun`, but gated so
  a stray/adversarial event cannot collapse the pinned sheet).
- **Auto-collapses once on completion.** A one-shot falling-edge (`firstRunOpen`
  true → false, tracked by `wasFirstRunOpenRef`) settles the sheet to half, and
  the onboarding scrim fades over ~400ms in step with the transition (cut under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`), revealing the retained home screen underneath. An
  ordinary session (onboarding never active) never triggers this transition,
  and the collapse gate is released so
  Escape/outside-tap/etc. work normally afterward.

The desktop `?shellMode=chat-overlay` shell mounts the (headless,
`firstRunComplete`-gated) conductor too, so a fresh chat-first desktop install
seeds the same in-chat onboarding; once first-run completes the mount is a
no-op (`App.chat-overlay-first-run.test.tsx`). The transcript's CHOICE widgets,
plus any OAuth/secret blocks they reveal, remain interactive alongside the
conductor-only text composer.

## Post-onboarding landing (#14362)

Onboarding finishes on chat and stays there. `completeFirstRun(landingTab)` —
the single finalizer in `useFirstRunCallbacks.ts` — flips the durable
completion gate, sets the tab, and marks `initialTabSetRef`, so the first
post-onboarding paint is already the landing surface. Cloud-only completion
(`completeCloudOnly` in `use-first-run-conductor.ts`) passes `"chat"`; the
BYOK/Settings escapes pass `"settings"`.

There is **no automatic character-select landing.** An earlier design (#13396)
routed the first post-onboarding boot to the full-screen character-select view
once, via a session-scoped `justCommitted` ref consumed in
`startup-phase-hydrate.ts`. That contradicted the one-obvious-path / chat-first
doctrine — two surfaces fought for the first impression — so the detour and its
`justCommitted` plumbing were removed. The hydrating phase now only lands a root
open on the default tab (chat) and lets a deep-linked URL win. Character
customization is reached explicitly from Settings/launcher, not forced on first
run. The regression is guarded by `startup-phase-hydrate.initial-tab.test.ts`
(root boot never routes to character-select) and
`onboarding-cloud-only.spec.ts` (no character-select surface after onboarding).

## Confused-user guards (conductor + send funnel)

Onboarding must survive a user who taps the wrong things, taps them twice, or
taps them out of order. The contract, enforced in `use-first-run-conductor.ts`
/ `first-run-action-channel.ts` / `first-run-finish.ts` and covered by
`use-first-run-conductor.test.ts` + the seeded storms in
`use-first-run-conductor.fuzz.test.ts`:

- **One flow at a time.** While a finish/provision call is in flight
  (`busyRef`), every other first-run pick — stale widgets, error re-seeds, the
  cloud-agent picker — is consumed as a no-op. No concurrent local+cloud
  provisioning is reachable.
- **Provisioned latch.** After provisioning succeeds only the tutorial pick is
  live; taps on leftover runtime/provider/cloud-agent widgets no-op instead of
  re-provisioning. The tutorial pick itself latches (`completedRef`), so a
  double-tap cannot re-fire `completeFirstRun` or launch a second tour.
- **Strict values.** Group ids are validated per group; malformed values under
  the reserved `__first_run__:` prefix are consumed, never acted on.
- **The prefix is reserved forever.** `classifyActionMessage` (the send
  funnel's routing contract in `AppContext.sendActionMessage`) drops
  `__first_run__:` values unconditionally — even after onboarding completes, a
  tap on a leftover onboarding widget never reaches the server as a literal
  sentinel chat message.
- **Exactly-once POST, even under races.** `persistFirstRun` memoizes its
  in-flight promise: concurrently double-fired finishes share one
  `POST /api/first-run`, and a failed POST releases the guard so a retry can
  post again.
- **No cloud dead end.** A failed/cancelled cloud login re-offers an UNLOCKED
  runtime CHOICE in the retry turn (earlier widgets lock on first tap), and
  arms a connect-and-resume continuation: if the user instead connects from
  the OAuth block, the interrupted flow resumes automatically when the store
  learns the connection landed. A fresh pick always supersedes the pending
  resume.
- **No finish dead end (the loop fix).** When a finish/provision flow fails —
  including a persistent `POST /api/first-run` failure such as a 404 — the
  conductor seeds a DISTINCT recovery turn (`first-run:error:*`) carrying its own
  `[CHOICE:first-run id=error]` with a human-readable message and three real ways
  forward: **Try again** (`error:retry`, re-runs the last runtime's finish),
  **Choose a different way to run** (`error:restart`, re-offers a fresh unlocked
  runtime CHOICE), and **Configure in Settings** (`error:settings`). It never
  re-appends the runtime question inline, so a repeating error can no longer loop
  the greeting forever.
- **"Other / configure in Settings" always escapes.** The `provider:other` pick
  (BYOK) does NOT run a local finish flow that could fail and re-loop; it opens
  the Settings tab (`setTab("settings")`) and exits first-run
  (`completeFirstRun("settings")`), landing the user where they configure a
  provider by hand. Both this and `error:settings` route through the same
  `exitToSettings` helper, latched by `completedRef` so a double-tap can't flip
  the gate twice.
