/**
 * The single stateful engine behind the shell's chat + voice surface, exposed as
 * the `ShellController` returned by `useShellController`. It drives the shell
 * phase (booting → needs-auth → idle → summoned → listening → responding), the rendered message
 * list, send + vision-capture, and the whole voice stack: mic capture (via the
 * voice-capture factory), wake-word listening, end-of-turn aggregation,
 * hands-free conversation looping, transcription-mode long-form recording, and
 * spoken assistant output (through useShellVoiceOutput). Conversation switching
 * and horizontal swipe navigation resolve through conversation-nav.
 *
 * ChatSurface / AssistantOverlay / ChatOverlay and the home surfaces
 * are the consumers; they read the controller and render, holding no chat/voice
 * state of their own. ShellControllerContext provides one instance so the pill
 * and the overlay stay in lock-step without double-mounting this hook.

  //     hands-free is engaged), re-open capture the instant we foreground
  //     instead of waiting for a user tap. The existing re-listen loop also
