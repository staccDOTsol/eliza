/**
 * Shell phase for the device-shell foundation (HomePill + AssistantOverlay +

 *
 *   booting    — startup not ready and popup closed; pill dim, no halo.
 *                Also the cloud-only auth-probe rest (`checking`) so a slow
 *                `/api/auth/me` never flashes the sign-in chip.
 *   needs-auth — cloud-only, proxy up, no Cloud session; labeled sign-in chip.
 *   idle       — ready, no overlay; pill solid.
 *   summoned   — overlay open, no active mic/response; faint halo.
 *   listening  — push-to-talk capture in flight; dark chip + live bars.
 *   processing — the mic is closed but the utterance is still being
 *                transcribed (STT drain after a hold-to-talk release); dark
 *                chip with pulsing dots — "I heard you, working on it"
 *                (#20483). Distinct from responding: no agent turn exists yet.
 *   responding — agent stream in flight; ambient glow (the pill further
 *                differentiates speaking via its `speaking` prop).

 *
