/**
 * Shared-runtime REST adapter (mobile chat unblock).
 *
 * A Tier-0 "shared" agent runs in-Worker (run-shared-agent-turn) with NO agent
 * server, so it has no `/api/*` REST surface — only the JSON-RPC bridge
 * (`message.send`) + the SSE stream. The mobile/web chat client, however, speaks
 * the agent-server REST conversation contract (`/api/conversations`,
 * `/api/conversations/:id/messages`, …). This use-case maps that REST contract
 * onto the conversation Durable Object, which owns cache-local execution,
 * billing coordination, and ordered history so a REST client can chat with a
 * shared agent unchanged. The cloud-api route at
 * `.../agents/:agentId/api/[...path]` is a thin caller of these functions.
 *
 * Launch model: one canonical conversation per agent (conversationId ===
 * agentId, bridge roomId === conversationId). The list always has exactly one
 * item, so no conversation index is needed.
