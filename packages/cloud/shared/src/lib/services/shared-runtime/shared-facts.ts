/**
 * Flag-gated durable knowledge extraction for the Shared edge runtime (parity
 * P4, #20615). After a landed user turn, a small extraction pass distills new
 * durable facts about the user and writes them into the SAME tenant-scoped
 * `shared_agent_memories` table Dedicated agents converge on, under the core
 * `facts` table-name discriminator — so a Shared→Dedicated upgrade carries the
 * accumulated knowledge with zero transformation.
 *
 * This module is pure orchestration over an injected `generate` collaborator:
 * it owns the extraction prompt, strict response parsing, normalization-based
 * dedupe against already-known facts, and the bounded rendering of the known
 * facts into a per-turn provider block. It performs no I/O of its own; the
 * caller (shared-runtime-chat) owns the model client, the store, and the
 * off-response-path scheduling, and a parse failure is a typed error — never a
 * fabricated empty result on a malformed body.
