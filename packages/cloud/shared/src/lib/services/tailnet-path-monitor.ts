/**
 * Detects a control-plane→agent tailnet path outage from the provisioning
 * daemon's own health-probe stream and makes it loud.
 *
 * The 2026-08-18 headscale ACL regression turned EVERY tailnet health probe
 * into a 360 s timeout for a day and a half without a single alert: each probe
 * failure looked like one slow container, provisioning retried, and nobody was
 * paged (elizaOS/eliza#22547 proof 7). One sick container cannot distinguish
 * itself from a severed path, but a run of consecutive timeouts across
 * DISTINCT containers with zero passes in between can — that is the signature
 * this monitor alarms on.
 *
 * The daemon (docker-sandbox-provider) reports every terminal probe outcome
 * here; the monitor fires the shared provisioning ops alert channels
 * (structured error log always; Slack/PagerDuty when configured) under its own
 * PagerDuty dedup key, re-alerts on a throttle while the outage persists, and
 * logs recovery on the first subsequent pass.
