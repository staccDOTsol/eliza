 * text from deltas — and the two extractors produced deltas at different
 * timings. Providing the authoritative accumulated text from the extractor
 * makes that entire category of reassembly bugs impossible.

 * callbacks (simple loggers, test spies) and async ones (network, TTS).

 * @param messageId - Streaming session / message identifier (UUID or opaque string).

 *   Undefined for raw-token streams (useModel without an extractor) where no
