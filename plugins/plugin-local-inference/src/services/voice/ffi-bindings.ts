/**
 * Node/Bun FFI binding to `libelizainference.{dylib,so,dll}`.
 *
 * The fused omnivoice + llama.cpp build (see
 * `packages/app-core/scripts/omnivoice-fuse/`) produces ONE shared
 * library that exports both `llama_*` and `omnivoice_*` symbols plus
 * the C ABI declared in `scripts/omnivoice-fuse/ffi.h`. This module is
 * the JS-side proxy for that ABI — it loads the library, binds every
 * `eliza_inference_*` symbol declared in `ffi.h`, and exposes a typed
 * handle (`ElizaInferenceFfi`) the voice lifecycle calls into.
 *
 * Runtime: production runs under Bun (Electrobun shell, Capacitor
 * bridge), so the loader uses `bun:ffi`. Tests that need to actually
 * load a `.dylib` against a stub library spawn a `bun` subprocess —
 * see `ffi-bindings.test.ts`. Calling this loader from a non-Bun
 * runtime (e.g. plain Node) throws `VoiceLifecycleError({code:
 * "missing-ffi"})` with a diagnostic explaining why.
 *
 * No defensive try/catch on the success path. Any dlopen failure,
 * symbol-resolution failure, or ABI mismatch is a structured throw
 * (AGENTS.md §3 + §9). The caller — `voice/lifecycle.ts` and
 * `voice/engine-bridge.ts` — surfaces it as a `VoiceLifecycleError` to
 * the UI.

 * The fused lib's sibling backends (`ggml*.dll`, `llama*.dll`, `mtmd.dll`) are
 * staged NEXT TO `elizainference.dll`, but when a DLL is opened by absolute
 * path the Win32 loader does NOT search that DLL's own directory for its

/**
 * ABI version the JS binding was authored against. The loader accepts this
 * version plus explicitly enumerated older additive surfaces whose missing
 * capabilities remain detectable through their probes; every other mismatch
 * is a hard error.
 *
 * Bump in lockstep with `ELIZA_INFERENCE_ABI_VERSION` in
 * `scripts/omnivoice-fuse/ffi.h` whenever the C surface changes shape.
 *
 * v4: the FFI bridge resolves `speaker_preset_id` against the bundle's
 *     `cache/voice-preset-<id>.bin` (ELZ2 v2) and applies the
 *     `(instruct, ref_audio_tokens, ref_T, ref_text)` triple to
 *     `ov_tts_params` before calling `ov_synthesize`. Adds the
 *     `eliza_inference_encode_reference` entrypoint that the freeze CLI
 *     uses to pre-encode reference WAVs into the preset file. A v3 caller
 *     remains source-compatible: every v3 entry point keeps its v3 shape.
 *
 * v5: the FFI bridge gains the native openWakeWord surface
 *     (`eliza_inference_wakeword_supported/open/score/reset/close`). It
 *     replaces the previous `onnxruntime-node`-backed wake-word path —
 *     the JS binding routes wake-word detection exclusively through this
 *     ABI with no ONNX fallback (AGENTS.md §3, §8). v4 callers that
 *     never touched the wake-word entries are source-compatible.
 *
 * v6: the FFI bridge gains the native speaker-encoder + diarizer
 *     surfaces (`eliza_inference_speaker_supported/open/embed/free/close`
 *     and `eliza_inference_diariz_supported/open/segment/close`). These
 *     fuse the remaining standalone `libvoice_classifier` voice
 *     classifiers into the one `libelizainference` handle so the whole
 *     voice pipeline runs through a single native lib. v5 callers that
 *     never touched the speaker/diarizer entries are source-compatible.
 *
 * v9: the last text-adjacent modalities move onto the fused handle. Three
 *     additive surfaces + probes: text embeddings (`embed` / `embedSupported`),
 *     mmproj vision describe (`describeImage` / `visionSupported`), and the
 *     tokenizer (`tokenize` / `detokenize` / `tokenizeSupported`). With these,
 *     libllama is fully retired: text, embeddings, vision, and tokenization all
 *     run through the fused handle. A pre-v9 library lacks these symbols, so the
 *     probes report unsupported and the fused runtime refuses (there is no
 *     libllama fallback). v8 callers that never touched the new entries remain
 *     source-compatible (the new probes simply return false on a v8 lib).
 *
 * v10: Kokoro-82M TTS folded in-process. The fused handle gains
 *     `eliza_inference_kokoro_supported/load/synthesize/sample_rate` so the
 *     mobile Kokoro path synthesizes through the same dlopen()-ed
 *     libelizainference as OmniVoice instead of POSTing to the local-TCP
 *     `llama-server /v1/audio/speech` route (forbidden on iOS / Google Play).
 *     The four symbols are additive — a v9 library lacks them, so the
 *     `kokoroSupported()` probe reports false and the Kokoro FFI runtime
 *     refuses (no TCP fallback on mobile). A v9 library is still accepted at
 *     degraded capability: its voice/ASR/VAD/LLM/text surface is unchanged and
 *     Kokoro just probes unsupported on it.
 *
 * v14: Kokoro IPA input + G2P-kind capability query. The fused handle gains
 *     `eliza_inference_kokoro_g2p_kind` (does the linked kokoro_lib phonemize
 *     raw text with real espeak-ng, or only the lossy ASCII grapheme fallback?)
 *     and `eliza_inference_kokoro_synthesize_ipa` (synthesize from precomputed
 *     espeak-ng IPA, bypassing the in-lib phonemizer). On an espeak-less build
 *     (Android / iOS / host without libespeak-ng) the raw-text path is
 *     unintelligible; the Kokoro runtime queries g2p_kind and, when ASCII, feeds
 *     the espeak-ng-WASM IPA it already computed through the IPA entry (#11776).
 *     The two symbols are additive — a v13 library lacks them, so the g2p-kind
 *     query reports "unknown" and the runtime keeps the raw-text path (with a
 *     loud one-time warning naming the fix). NOTE: v13 (token-by-token vision
 *     describe) is the main-lineage vision surface; the develop-pinned fork
 *     lineage advances 12 -> 14 for the Kokoro IPA surface (fork-sync #11386)
 *     so the two independent bumps stay collision-free.
 *
 * v15: Kokoro adds exact-size, library-owned PCM allocation entrypoints. The
 *     change is additive: every v14 symbol and function shape used by this
 *     binding is unchanged. Until the JS Kokoro path adopts the allocation
 *     entries it intentionally keeps using the v14 caller-buffer functions;
 *     v14 libraries therefore remain valid at that degraded capability.
