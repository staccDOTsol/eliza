/**
 * Runs the text-model wire-contract shape matrix together for changes that
 * cross `models/text.ts` — request normalization (messages, tools, schemas),
 * transient-error classification, and provider-error enrichment. Suites that
 * `vi.mock("ai")` (native-plumbing, stream-start-retry, streamstructured)
 * cannot compose into one file — their module mocks are file-scoped and
 * collide — so they stay standalone.
