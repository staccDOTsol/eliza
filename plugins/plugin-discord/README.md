- Voice event management via the voice manager
- Manage and process new messages with the message manager
- Slash command registration and interaction handling
- Support for Discord attachments and media files
- Voice channel join/leave functionality
- Media transcription for voice and attachments
- Channel restriction support (limit bot to specific channels)
- Robust permissions management and audit event tracking
- Event-driven architecture with comprehensive event handling
- History backfill with efficient batch processing

## Installation

As this is a workspace package, it is installed as part of the elizaOS monorepo:

```bash
bun install
```

## Configuration

### Enabling the connector (boot contract)

`plugin-discord` is an **optional** core plugin: it is not loaded by default just
because a token is present. To boot the connector you must opt in via the agent
config, not only through env:

```jsonc
// eliza.json
{
  "connectors": {
    "discord": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

The config key `connectors.discord` is what maps the agent to
`@elizaos/plugin-discord` (via `channel-plugin-map.json`); a character with an
empty `plugins: []` and no `connectors.discord` entry will boot with
`connectors: {}` and emit zero Discord log lines even with valid credentials.

The plugin requires the following environment variables:

```bash
# Discord API Credentials (Required)
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id
DISCORD_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Channel Restrictions (Optional)
# Comma-separated list of Discord channel IDs to restrict the bot to.
# If not set, the bot operates in all channels.
CHANNEL_IDS=123456789012345678,987654321098765432

# Listen-only channels (Optional)
# Comma-separated list of channel IDs where the bot will only listen (not respond).
DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS=123456789012345678

# Voice Channel (Optional)
# ID of the voice channel the bot should auto-join when scanning a guild.
# If not set, the bot selects based on member activity.
DISCORD_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# Behavior Settings (Optional)
# If true, ignore messages from other bots (default: true)
DISCORD_SHOULD_IGNORE_BOT_MESSAGES=true

# If true, ignore direct messages by default (default: true).
# DMs can still be allowed explicitly via DISCORD_ALLOW_FROM / pairing allowlist.
DISCORD_SHOULD_IGNORE_DIRECT_MESSAGES=true

# If true, only respond when explicitly @mentioned (default: true)
DISCORD_SHOULD_RESPOND_ONLY_TO_MENTIONS=true

# Generation Timeout (Optional)
# Wall-clock budget for generating a single reply before the bot gives up and
# posts "I timed out while generating that reply." On timeout the underlying
# model call is ABORTED (the abort signal threads through to runtime.useModel /
# the provider fetch), so an orphaned run cannot keep burning tokens or race a
# late response into the same channel.
#   Default: 120000 (2 min). Minimum: 30000 (values below the floor are raised).
#   Set to 0 to DISABLE the timeout entirely (await generation to completion —
#   useful for long media jobs like video). Falls back to MESSAGE_TIMEOUT_MS,
#   then to the media-generation timeout, when unset.
# For heavy-context / multi-step agentic turns on cloud models, raise this
# (e.g. 240000) rather than leaving replies to hit the 2-min cap.
DISCORD_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS=120000

# Testing (Optional)
DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# Owner Alias Override (Optional)
# JSON array of Discord user IDs that intentionally alias to the canonical
# Eliza owner entity. Do not put ordinary Discord application team members here;
# they stay auditable as separate connector-admin identities.
ELIZA_DISCORD_OWNER_USER_IDS_JSON='["123456789012345678"]'
```

Settings can also be configured in your character file under `settings.discord`:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "discord": {
      "shouldIgnoreBotMessages": true,
      "shouldIgnoreDirectMessages": true,
      "shouldRespondOnlyToMentions": true,
      "allowedChannelIds": ["123456789012345678"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-discord"]
}
```

## Slash Command Permissions

The plugin uses a hybrid permission system that combines Discord's native features with elizaOS-specific controls.

### Permission Layers

Commands go through multiple permission checks in this order:

1. **Discord Native Checks** (before interaction fires):
   - User must have required Discord permissions
   - Command must be available in the current context (guild vs DM)

2. **elizaOS Channel Whitelist** (if `CHANNEL_IDS` is set):
   - Commands only work in whitelisted channels
   - Unless command has `bypassChannelWhitelist: true`

3. **Custom Validator** (if provided):
   - Runs custom validation logic
   - Full programmatic control

### Registering Commands

```typescript
import { PermissionFlagsBits } from "discord.js";

// Simple command (works everywhere)
const helpCommand = {
  name: "help",
  description: "Show help information",
};

// Guild-only command
const serverInfoCommand = {
  name: "serverinfo",
  description: "Show server information",
  guildOnly: true,
};

// Requires Discord permission
const configCommand = {
  name: "config",
  description: "Configure bot settings",
  requiredPermissions: PermissionFlagsBits.ManageGuild,
};

// Bypasses channel whitelist
const utilityCommand = {
  name: "export",
  description: "Export data",
  bypassChannelWhitelist: true,
};

// Advanced: custom validation
const adminCommand = {
  name: "admin",
  description: "Admin-only command",
  validator: async (interaction, runtime) => {
    const adminIds = runtime.getSetting("ADMIN_USER_IDS")?.split(",") ?? [];
    return adminIds.includes(interaction.user.id);
  },
};

// Register commands
await runtime.emitEvent(["DISCORD_REGISTER_COMMANDS"], {
  commands: [
    helpCommand,
    serverInfoCommand,
    configCommand,
    utilityCommand,
    adminCommand,
  ],
});
```

### Permission Options

| Option                   | Type               | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `guildOnly`              | `boolean`          | If true, command only works in guilds (not DMs)                       |
| `bypassChannelWhitelist` | `boolean`          | If true, bypasses `CHANNEL_IDS` restrictions                          |
| `requiredPermissions`    | `bigint \| string` | Discord permission bitfield (e.g., `PermissionFlagsBits.ManageGuild`) |
| `contexts`               | `number[]`         | Raw Discord contexts (0=Guild, 1=BotDM, 2=PrivateChannel)             |
| `guildIds`               | `string[]`         | Register only in specific guilds (instant updates)                    |
| `validator`              | `function`         | Custom validation function for advanced logic                         |

### Common Permission Values

From Discord.js `PermissionFlagsBits`:

- `ManageGuild` - Server settings
- `ManageChannels` - Channel management
- `ManageMessages` - Delete messages
- `BanMembers` - Ban users
- `KickMembers` - Kick users
- `ModerateMembers` - Timeout users
- `ManageRoles` - Role management
- `Administrator` - Full access

### Actions / Providers

No actions or providers are registered. The plugin operates entirely through services and events. Credential pairing is handled by connector account providers and owner-only slash commands.

### Server Management (structural guild operations)

The connector exposes structural server management through the platform
`MESSAGE` action (`op=manage_server`, `source=discord`). Supported
operations:

- `create_category`, `create_channel`, `edit_channel`, `delete_channel`
- `create_role`, `edit_role`, `delete_role`
- `edit_permissions` (channel permission overwrites)
- `assign_role`, `remove_role`
- `create_invite`
- `kick`, `ban`, `unban`, `timeout`
- `list_templates`, `apply_template` (idempotent, non-destructive guild
  template reconcile)

Management requests must identify the destination with the exact Discord guild
snowflake persisted as the room's `serverId`; guild display names are never an
authorization or lookup key. For example:

```json
{
  "action": "create_channel",
  "source": "discord",
  "accountId": "primary",
  "serverId": "123456789012345678",
  "name": "release-status"
}
```

Before Discord is queried or changed, core requires a verified identity related
to the requester to be both a member and `ADMIN` or `OWNER` in that exact
destination world. The destination must also have an exact Discord room binding
for the selected connector account (`room.source`, raw guild `room.serverId`,
and `room.metadata.accountId`). The Discord connector independently revalidates
the same binding, membership, and role immediately before mutation, so revoked,
unbound, cross-account, and cross-guild requests fail closed.

**Every structural write fails closed.** The `actions.channels`,
`actions.roles`, `actions.permissions`, and `actions.moderation` gates all
default to OFF and must be explicitly enabled:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "discord": {
      "token": "<bot token>",
      "actions": {
        "channels": true,
        "roles": true,
        "permissions": true,
        "moderation": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Environment fallbacks: `DISCORD_ACTIONS_CHANNELS`, `DISCORD_ACTIONS_ROLES`,
`DISCORD_ACTIONS_PERMISSIONS`, `DISCORD_ACTIONS_MODERATION` (only consulted
when the config key is absent).

Additional guardrails, independent of the gates:

- The bot must actually hold the Discord-side permission (`ManageChannels`,
  `ManageRoles`, `CreateInstantInvite`, `KickMembers`, `BanMembers`,
  `ModerateMembers`) for the verb, or the operation fails with an actionable
  error.
- Role and member-role writes enforce Discord role hierarchy: only roles
  strictly below the bot's highest role can be created against, edited,
  deleted, or assigned. Integration-managed roles and `@everyone` are
  refused.
- Granting the `Administrator` permission through any role or overwrite is
  always rejected, and requested role permissions must be a subset of the
  bot's own permissions (no escalation).
- Moderation refuses to target the guild owner and honors
  `kickable`/`bannable`/`moderatable`.
- Every operation accepts `dryRun: true` and returns a structured receipt
  listing created/updated/unchanged/skipped entities.

#### Guild templates

`apply_template` reconciles a declarative guild spec (roles, categories,
channels, permission overwrites) against the live guild:

- Objects are matched by stable template `key` via a persisted
  key-to-snowflake map (runtime cache), with exact-name fallback, so
  re-applying converges (`unchanged`) instead of duplicating.
- Reconcile creates missing objects and updates explicitly managed fields
  (name, topic, parent, color, hoist, mentionable, permissions, overwrites).
- It NEVER deletes channels or roles it does not manage; manual channels
  and roles are untouched. Deletion only happens through the explicit
  `delete_channel` / `delete_role` verbs.
- `dryRun: true` returns the full plan (`would_create` / `would_update`)
  without touching Discord.

Built-in vendor-neutral templates: `companion-private`, `friends-casual`,
`project-team`, `community-public`. Deployments can add or override
templates via `settings.discord.guildTemplates` (per-account:
`settings.discord.accounts.<id>.guildTemplates`):

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "discord": {
      "guildTemplates": {
        "my-workspace": {
          "id": "my-workspace",
          "categories": [{ "key": "ops", "name": "OPS" }],
          "channels": [
            { "key": "receipts", "name": "receipts", "parent": "ops" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`{{agent}}` in template names renders the character name; custom variables
can be supplied per apply via `variables`.

### Event Types

The plugin emits the following Discord-specific events:

| Event                                 | Description                               |

## Developer Guide

### Custom Slash Commands

Register slash commands via the `DISCORD_REGISTER_COMMANDS` event, then listen for interactions:

```typescript
// Register custom slash commands
await runtime.emitEvent(["DISCORD_REGISTER_COMMANDS"], {
  commands: [
    {
      name: "mycommand",
      description: "My custom command",
      options: [
        {
          name: "input",
          description: "User input",
          type: 3, // STRING type
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "serverinfo",
      description: "Get server information",
      guildOnly: true, // Only works in guilds, not DMs
    },
  ],
});

// Listen for slash command events to handle the interaction
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: "DISCORD_SLASH_COMMAND",
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const { interaction, client, commands } = payload;

    if (interaction.commandName === "mycommand") {
      const input = interaction.options.getString("input");
      await interaction.reply(`You said: ${input}`);
    }
  },
});
```

### Building on the Listen System

The `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` setting creates "listen-only" channels where the bot receives messages but doesn't respond. This is useful for:

- **Monitoring channels** - Track activity without interrupting conversations
- **Data collection** - Gather messages for analysis or training
- **Conditional responses** - Build custom logic that decides when to respond

```typescript
// Check if a channel is listen-only
const listenChannels = runtime.getSetting("DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS");
const listenChannelIds = listenChannels?.split(",").map((s) => s.trim()) || [];

runtime.registerEvent({
  name: "DISCORD_MESSAGE_RECEIVED",
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const { message } = payload;
    const channelId = message.content.channelId;

    if (listenChannelIds.includes(channelId)) {
      // This is a listen-only channel - process without responding
      await processMessageSilently(message);
    }
  },
});
```

### Handling Modal and Component Interactions

Modal submits and button components bypass channel whitelists to support multi-step UI flows:

```typescript
// Listen for modal submissions
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: "DISCORD_MODAL_SUBMIT",
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const { interaction } = payload;
    const fieldValue = interaction.fields.getTextInputValue("myField");
    await interaction.reply(`Received: ${fieldValue}`);
  },
});
```

### Permission Audit System

The plugin includes a comprehensive permission audit system that tracks all permission changes with full audit log integration. This is useful for:

- **Security monitoring** - Detect unauthorized permission escalations
- **Compliance logging** - Maintain records of who changed what and when
- **Bot self-protection** - Detect when the bot's permissions are modified

#### Event Payloads

**DISCORD_CHANNEL_PERMISSIONS_CHANGED** - When channel overwrites change:

```typescript
interface ChannelPermissionsChangedPayload {
  runtime: IAgentRuntime;
  guild: { id: string; name: string };
  channel: { id: string; name: string };
  target: { type: "role" | "user"; id: string; name: string };
  action: "CREATE" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE";
  changes: Array<{
    permission: string; // e.g., 'ManageMessages', 'Administrator'
    oldState: "ALLOW" | "DENY" | "NEUTRAL";
    newState: "ALLOW" | "DENY" | "NEUTRAL";
  }>;
  audit: {
    executorId: string;
    executorTag: string;
    reason: string | null;
  } | null;
}
```

**DISCORD_ROLE_PERMISSIONS_CHANGED** - When role permissions change:

```typescript
interface RolePermissionsChangedPayload {
  runtime: IAgentRuntime;
  guild: { id: string; name: string };
  role: { id: string; name: string };
  changes: PermissionDiff[];
  audit: AuditInfo | null;
}
```

**DISCORD_MEMBER_ROLES_CHANGED** - When a member's roles change:

```typescript
interface MemberRolesChangedPayload {
  runtime: IAgentRuntime;
  guild: { id: string; name: string };
  member: { id: string; tag: string };
  added: Array<{ id: string; name: string; permissions: string[] }>;
  removed: Array<{ id: string; name: string; permissions: string[] }>;
  audit: AuditInfo | null;
}
```

**DISCORD_ROLE_CREATED / DISCORD_ROLE_DELETED** - Role lifecycle:

```typescript
interface RoleLifecyclePayload {
  runtime: IAgentRuntime;
  guild: { id: string; name: string };
  role: { id: string; name: string; permissions: string[] };
  audit: AuditInfo | null;
}
```

#### Example: Security Monitoring

```typescript
import { DiscordEventTypes } from "@elizaos/plugin-discord";
import { logger } from "@elizaos/core";

// Alert on dangerous permission grants
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: DiscordEventTypes.CHANNEL_PERMISSIONS_CHANGED,
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const dangerousPerms = ["Administrator", "ManageGuild", "ManageRoles"];

    for (const change of payload.changes) {
      if (
        dangerousPerms.includes(change.permission) &&
        change.newState === "ALLOW"
      ) {
        logger.warn(
          { channel: payload.channel.name, target: payload.target.name, permission: change.permission, grantedBy: payload.audit?.executorTag || "Unknown" },
          "[SecurityMonitor] Dangerous permission granted",
        );
      }
    }
  },
});

// Track role escalations
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: DiscordEventTypes.MEMBER_ROLES_CHANGED,
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const adminRoles = payload.added.filter((r) =>
      r.permissions.includes("Administrator"),
    );

    if (adminRoles.length > 0) {
      logger.warn(
        { member: payload.member.tag, roles: adminRoles.map((r) => r.name), grantedBy: payload.audit?.executorTag || "Unknown" },
        "[SecurityMonitor] Admin role granted",
      );
    }
  },
});

// Log all role creations
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: DiscordEventTypes.ROLE_CREATED,
  handler: async (payload) => {
    logger.info(
      { role: payload.role.name, permissions: payload.role.permissions, createdBy: payload.audit?.executorTag || "Unknown" },
      "[SecurityMonitor] New role created",
    );
  },
});
```

#### Bot Self-Protection

Monitor when the bot's own permissions change:

```typescript
runtime.registerEvent({
  name: DiscordEventTypes.MEMBER_ROLES_CHANGED,
  handler: async (payload) => {
    const botId = runtime.getSetting("DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID");

    if (payload.member.id === botId && payload.removed.length > 0) {
      logger.error(
        { removed: payload.removed.map((r) => r.name), by: payload.audit?.executorTag || "Unknown" },
        "[SecurityMonitor] Bot roles removed",
      );
    }
  },
});
```

## Cross-Core Compatibility

This plugin includes a type-level compatibility layer (`compat.ts`) so it typechecks against both old and new versions of `@elizaos/core`. It exports widened types (`ICompatRuntime`, `WorldCompat`, `RoomCompat`) that allow either `serverId` or `messageServerId` on `World`/`Room` objects and on the `ensureConnection`/`ensureWorldExists`/`ensureRoomExists` runtime methods. There is no runtime proxy — it is purely TypeScript declarations consumed where the runtime is referenced (`service.ts`, `messages.ts`, `voice.ts`, `discord-interactions.ts`, `discord-history.ts`).

## Testing

The plugin includes a test suite for validating functionality:

```bash
bun run test
```

## Notes

- Ensure that your `.env` file includes the required `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`
- The bot requires appropriate Discord permissions (send messages, connect to voice, etc.)
- If no token is provided, the plugin will load but remain non-functional with appropriate warnings
- The plugin uses discord.js v14 (`^14.26.4`) with comprehensive intent support
- Slash commands and modal/component interactions bypass channel whitelists
