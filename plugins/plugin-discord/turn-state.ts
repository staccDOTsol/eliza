/**
 * Durable turn / outbox state machine for Discord inbound replies.
 *
 * Motivation (SOLIZA cutover charter rows D4/D5): PR #16696 makes an
 * already-persisted inbound Discord message suppress a second model turn on
 * redelivery. That closes the double-dispatch window but opens a worse one: a
 * crash AFTER inbound memory persistence but BEFORE the outbound reply leaves
 * the turn permanently suppressed on replay, so no reply is ever sent.
 *
 * This module records a durable turn record keyed by the Discord message id and
 * drives it through an explicit lifecycle so a resumed process can tell the
 * difference between "already replied" (no-op) and "persisted but never
 * replied" (resume the reply path with bounded retries, then terminal FAILED).
 *
 * Delivery model: SEND-THEN-RECORD with a durable reply-memory probe.
 *
 *   Why send-then-record rather than record-then-send? The Discord connector
 *   already writes a durable outbound *reply memory* for every message it
 *   emits, stamped with `content.inReplyTo = <inbound message id>` and
 *   `metadata.platformMessageId = <discord reply id>` (see the response
 *   callback in messages.ts). That reply memory IS the authoritative
 *   record-of-send. Introducing a separate "reserved-before-send" outbox row
 *   would create a second source of truth that can itself desync from Discord
 *   on a crash between reserve and send. Instead we reconcile against the
 *   reply-memory that the send path already produces:
 *
 *     - Before (re)dispatching a resumed turn, probe for an existing reply
 *       memory in the room whose `inReplyTo` matches this inbound. If one
 *       exists, the reply already went out (a crash happened AFTER send but
 *       BEFORE we could stamp the turn REPLIED); we reconcile the turn to
 *       REPLIED and DO NOT send again. This is the "reconcile check" that makes
 *       send-then-record safe against a crash in the send<->record gap.
 *     - Only if no reply memory exists do we resume dispatch. The generation
 *       and send path is idempotent-on-content via #15601's outbound reservation
 *       and #13054's outbound memory dedupe, so a bounded retry cannot fan out.
 *
 * The turn record is stored as an ordinary memory in a dedicated table so it
 * inherits the same durability, restart survival, and (optional) retention as
 * the rest of the store, with no schema migration.
