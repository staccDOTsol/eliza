# Default Eliza Skills And Agent Bridge Plan

Date: 2026-05-10

## Goal

Make Eliza's default task workers self-sufficient:

- They should receive editable, repo-owned default skills for Eliza, elizaOS plugin/app development, Eliza Cloud APIs, and monetization.
- Claude, Codex, and OpenCode workers should receive those defaults through the ACP agent orchestrator.
- Applications should be able to override defaults without forking the shipped skill package.
- Workers should be able to ask the running parent Eliza agent for context or actions that only the parent can perform.
- Paid, private, or destructive operations should remain mediated by the parent agent and its confirmation flow.

## Current Inventory

### Shipped skills

Repo-owned default skills live under:

```text
packages/skills/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md
```

The `@elizaos/skills` package publishes those files. Runtime startup wires bundled, workspace, and extra skill roots through `packages/agent/src/runtime/eliza.ts`. Managed/workspace copies override bundled defaults.

Relevant shipped skills now include:

- `eliza` for the running Eliza app, parent-agent callback protocol, capabilities, and lifecycle.
- `elizaos` for upstream runtime/plugin abstractions.
- `eliza-app-development` for this app repo's build and edit workflow.
- `eliza-cloud` for Cloud APIs, apps, credits, billing, containers, domains, auth, and earnings.
- `build-monetized-app` for the new-app deploy and monetization loop.
- `task-agent-eliza-bridge` for low-level task-agent bridge details.

### Agent orchestration

The task agent infrastructure is in `plugins/plugin-agent-orchestrator`.

Important surfaces:

- `src/services/acp-service.ts` spawns ACP agents, records session metadata, and manages session lifecycle.
- `src/actions/tasks.ts` prepares ACP spawn/send/list/control requests through the single task-agent action surface.
- `src/services/skill-manifest.ts` renders the task-local manifest and virtual broker skills.
- `src/services/skill-lifeops-context-broker.ts` already exposes task-scoped LifeOps context.

### Cloud and monetization

Current Cloud source-of-truth files:

- OpenAPI: `cloud/apps/api/openapi.json/route.ts`
- SDK: `cloud/packages/sdk/src/client.ts`
- billing/pricing: `cloud/packages/lib/services/ai-billing.ts`, `ai-pricing.ts`, `credits.ts`
- app chat: `cloud/apps/api/v1/apps/[id]/chat/route.ts`
- OpenAI-compatible chat: `cloud/apps/api/v1/chat/completions/route.ts`
- app monetization: `cloud/apps/api/v1/apps/[id]/monetization/route.ts`
- app credits: `cloud/packages/lib/services/app-credits.ts`
- container billing: `cloud/apps/api/cron/container-billing/route.ts`

Active app monetization is markup/share based. Inference in the current app-chat path debits the caller/user org credits and credits creator markup to redeemable earnings. App-credit purchase/share flows exist, but should not be assumed to fund inference unless the endpoint being edited explicitly does so.

## Implemented Architecture

### Default editable skills

Default skills remain bundled in `@elizaos/skills` and are seeded into the managed skills directory only when the user does not already have an editable copy.

Applications and workspaces can override defaults by placing a same-slug skill in a higher-priority skill root. This preserves:

- global defaults included with Eliza
- user/application customization
- stable slugs for orchestrator recommendation and invocation
- short `SKILL.md` bodies with longer references under `references/`

`packages/app-core/scripts/ensure-skills.mjs` resolves the shipped skill tree from `@elizaos/skills`, then falls back to `packages/skills/skills`, then legacy `skills/`.

### Parent-agent broker

A new virtual broker skill, `parent-agent`, lets a child ask the running parent Eliza agent to use its loaded capabilities:

```text
USE_SKILL parent-agent {"request":"Find the next open 30 minute slot on my calendar tomorrow afternoon"}
```

The broker builds a synthetic message memory and sends it through the parent's normal `messageService.handleMessage(...)` pipeline with `continueAfterActions: true`. This means the parent can use the same actions, providers, services, connectors, model handlers, confirmation policies, and user approval flow it already uses for normal chat. A repository-editing request may explicitly add `"executionMode":"coding"` to select the parent coding planner and its mutation-verification contract. The option changes planning behavior only: it grants no authority and does not bypass action validation, role gates, connector policy, or confirmation.

It also supports action discovery:

```text
USE_SKILL parent-agent {"mode":"list-actions","query":"github","limit":25}
```

Sensitive broker access is session allow-listed. The orchestrator includes `parent-agent` in generated manifests for coding-task sessions and registers the manifest slugs as the session allow-list.

### Worker manifest

`SKILLS.md` now tells workers to emit a standalone `USE_SKILL <slug> <json_args>` line. The orchestrator writes this manifest into the workspace and sets `ELIZA_SKILLS_MANIFEST`, so Codex/Claude/OpenCode workers can discover skill protocol without hardcoding.

The injected parent runtime memory also now explains:

- read-only loopback endpoints
- `ELIZA_SKILLS_MANIFEST` / `SKILLS.md`
- `USE_SKILL parent-agent`
- `USE_SKILL lifeops-context`
- when to ask the parent for connector/private/paid actions

### Git hygiene

The orchestrator-managed gitignore block now includes common generated agent files:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.claude/`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.codex/`
- `.opencode/`
- `SKILLS.md`

Tracked repo files with the same names still need care; ignore rules only prevent new untracked files from being committed.

## Security Model

The child worker never receives the parent API key, full memory dump, or raw connector credentials.

Allowed paths:

- read-only loopback endpoints for bounded parent context
- `USE_SKILL` directives for session allow-listed skill/broker slugs
- parent-agent requests mediated by the parent message pipeline
- parent confirmation flow for paid, destructive, private, or external operations

Denied or discouraged paths:

- ad hoc POSTs to loopback context endpoints
- bypassing Cloud/user confirmation for paid steps
- directly recreating parent credentials inside a child workspace
- treating task-agent output as a persistent authenticated identity

## Five-Pass Implementation Plan

### Pass 1: Prep

- Inventory shipped skills and confirm `@elizaos/skills` is the bundled default source.
- Inventory orchestrator spawn/memory/manifest/callback code.
- Inventory Cloud billing, monetization, app chat, SDK, and container deploy source-of-truth files.
- Decide stable slugs and default override model.
- Define task-scoped broker protocol and sensitive-broker allow-list behavior.

Status: implemented for the default skill and broker surfaces.

### Pass 2: Implementation

- Add `eliza` default skill and references.
- Expand app-development, Cloud, monetization, and task-agent bridge skills.
- Fix root shipped-skill seeding to resolve `@elizaos/skills`.
- Add `parent-agent` virtual broker.
- Include `parent-agent` in `SKILLS.md` and the session allow-list.
- Update worker memory injection and manifest protocol text.
- Add generated agent files to orchestrator gitignore.

Status: implemented.

### Pass 3: Cleanup

- Keep skill prose short and push details into references.
- Remove stale "read-only only / no action delegation" wording from task-agent bridge docs.
- Correct monetization docs where they implied app-specific inference balances in the active route.
- Align Cloud skill references to current implementation files.

Status: implemented.

### Pass 4: Review And Fixing

Review focus:

- Type correctness around synthetic `Memory` construction and `messageService.handleMessage`.
- Session allow-list behavior for virtual brokers.
- Whether all ACP agent types can see `SKILLS.md` and parent memory text.
- Whether tracked `AGENTS.md` repos need a safer memory-file strategy than writing in the workspace root.
- Whether OpenCode's vendored ACP path has enough smoke coverage against Cerebras.

Status: partially implemented. The first three are covered by code/tests; live OpenCode/Cerebras validation remains credential-gated.

### Pass 5: Testing, Verification, Validation

Minimum local tests:

- unit test `parent-agent` broker list-actions, missing request, and message pipeline callback capture
- unit test `USE_SKILL` directive parsing and sensitive broker routing if practical
- typecheck `plugin-agent-orchestrator`
- test `packages/skills` loader/frontmatter paths
- run `packages/app-core/scripts/ensure-skills.mjs` against a temporary `ELIZA_STATE_DIR`

Live validation:

- Start a parent Eliza runtime with agent skills and orchestrator loaded.
- Spawn Codex, Claude, and OpenCode workers and verify they read `SKILLS.md`.
- Spawn OpenCode through ACP using the vendored OpenCode shim with Cerebras `gpt-oss-120b` and verify it can emit `USE_SKILL parent-agent ...`.
- Simulate:
  - action listing
  - parent memory search
  - calendar/GitHub/browser-style parent request
  - confirmation-required paid Cloud/domain request
  - denied broker when not allow-listed
  - task continuation after a returned parent result
- Run existing SWE/orchestrator benchmarks with and without the broker skill hint.

Status: local unit/type/skills tests are implemented and passing. Live OpenCode/Cerebras/SWE benchmarking requires running services and credentials, so it remains follow-up unless the environment already has them active.

## Remaining Gaps

- Writing adapter memory files named `AGENTS.md` can collide with repos that already track `AGENTS.md`. A safer strategy is needed for Codex memory injection in tracked-repo workspaces.
- Live agent benchmarking against OpenCode + Eliza Cloud + Cerebras requires credentials and running infrastructure.
- The parent-agent broker currently asks through the normal parent message pipeline. Direct action invocation APIs could be added later, but the message path is more flexible and preserves confirmation behavior.

## AGI-Level Direction

The long-term target is not a hardcoded "agent helper" action. It is a capability broker:

- the parent runtime exposes a typed capability graph derived from loaded plugins, actions, providers, services, connectors, and policies
- workers receive task-scoped manifests and can request capabilities without knowing implementation details
- the parent decides whether to answer, execute, request confirmation, redact, or deny
- applications override skills and policies by configuration rather than editing orchestrator code
- benchmarks measure whether workers solve more repo tasks with fewer human interventions and fewer credential leaks

The current implementation establishes the default skill surface and the child-to-parent request path needed for that architecture.
